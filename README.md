## Getting started

To run these tutorials locally on your machine, you can download the files individually. Or simply clone the whole repository using `git clone`, as follows.

First you might want to create a directory where your Git repositories can live:

```
mkdir ~/git
cd ~/git
```

Then use `git clone` to make a local copy on your computer:

```
git clone https://github.com/aomlomics/tutorials.git
